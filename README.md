## Notes

### Navbar Section

The navbar is composed of two main elements:
- The Logo
- The menu

The logo can be anything from an SVG element or an image file (.png or .icon), while the menu can jump to any other page or section in the website.


### Hero Section

It's what the user is greeted with when they enter the page; the name of the website, a brief description, and an attractive image.

There is also a quick access button for signing up.


### Card Section

This section can be used to place some random information and some pictures about the topic of the website, to appeal to the user.

Each card holds a place for a picture and a brief description of the picture.


### Sign-up Section

When the user reaches the end of the page, he should be reminded to sign up.
