## Notes

### Navbar Section

The navbar is composed of two main elements:
- The Logo
- The menu

The logo can be anything from an SVG element or an image file (.png or .icon), while the menu can jump to any other page or section in the website.


### Hero Section

It's what the user is greeted with when they enter the page; the name of the website, a brief description, and an attractive image.

There is also a quick access button for signing up.
